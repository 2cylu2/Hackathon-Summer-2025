# University of Rochester Biomedical Data Science Hackathon Summer 2025
Welcome to the landing page for the hackathon. The event will run from 8/17/25 through 8/23/2025 online. We will host a hybrid kick off event on **Monday 8/18/25 4 - 5 pm** in Wegmans 1400 or zoom (register for the hackathon to receive the zoom link). Please join us to learn about the competition and meet fellow participants.

 Please make sure each individual competing on your team is fully registered. Each team needs a captain with a github handle. To receive a prize, you must supply your University of Rochester e-mail address. All teams scoring better than random will receive a participation prize. 1st and 2nd place winning teams in each division will get a cash prize (see below).
 **All team members must submit their own registration form to receive prizes.** To finish your team registration or to register for an existing team, use this [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScDODn2UyefKIDaCjTlYF29xjRNgk2aJ98NtVksoDU1kFL44w/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=101864452815264823434). 


# Logistics

0.   Each team must have a github handle associated with it in order to participate.  Make sure you edit your registration or email the organizers to provide this, if you haven't yet. Your team will not be scored if you do not provide a handle.
1.   You may add team members up
to noon EDT on 8/14 by editing your response to the google form or emailing the organizers.
2.  Teams of entirely undergraduates will be in the undergraduate
division, else they will be in the open division.
3.  Predictions on test data set are submitted by pushing to
    github.  A repository with the name `Hackathon-Summer-2025`,
    owned by the team captain, will
    be queried for a file named [prediction/prediction.csv](prediction/prediction.csv). Your predictions should be formatted in the exact same way and in the same order as the sample prediction file. Just replace the example TRUE/FALSE predictions with your own.  **If the team captain forks this
    repository and writes predictions there everything should work
    (as long as the predictions are formatted correctly).** 
2.  Predictions will be scored at least once daily, starting 8/20, with
    scores posted by 3 PM.  At
    the organizers' option, predictions may be scored more frequently
    than this.
2.  General questions/problems can be directed to [issues](https://github.com/Rochester-Biomedical-DS/Hackathon-Summer-2025/issues) page.  We encourage other hackathon participants to respond to issues.
3.  The scoreboard will be located
    [here](Leaderboard.Hackathon.2025.md).
   
    We  cannot provide support
    beyond the diagnostic output included on the scoreboard if an error is
    encountered in scoring your predictions.
5.  Interim scoring may employ forms of randomization (e.g. bootstrapping) from the test data set.  The final scores will use all the data and not be randomized.
4.  Competition runs through 2:59 PM EDT 23-August-2025.  The predictions each team has committed to their repository at that time will be used to determine their final score. Captains must submit their own predictions. Any use of predictions from other teams is disqualifying. Winning teams must submit their code to organizers to claim their prize.

**The data will be released here Aug 15**
